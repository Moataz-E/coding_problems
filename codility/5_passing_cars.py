"""
A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given. The consecutive elements
of array A represent consecutive cars on a road.

Array A contains only 0s and/or 1s:

* 0 represents a car traveling east,
* 1 represents a car traveling west.

The goal is to count passing cars. We say that a pair of cars (P, Q), where
0 â‰¤ P < Q < N, is passing when P is traveling to the east and Q is traveling to
the west.

    We traverse the array and keep track of how many cars travelling east we've
