Go through array and create a set of all elements seen.

while set isn't empty, go through array removing all seen elements.

Maintain a counter during the while loop, so once it stop the counter
represents the first covering prefix.


Solution notes:
nlogn because as we loop, we remove elements from the set we are searching. This
results in a smaller search space at hence an nlogn runtime instead n^2
