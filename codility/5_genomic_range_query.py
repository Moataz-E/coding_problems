"""
A DNA sequence can be represented as a string consisting of the letters A, C, G
and T, which correspond to the types of successive nucleotides in the sequence.
Each nucleotide has an impact factor, which is an integer. Nucleotides of types
A, C, G and T have impact factors of 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. You are going
to answer several queries of the form: What is the minimal impact factor of
nucleotides contained in a particular part of the given DNA sequence?

The DNA sequence is given as a non-empty string S = S[0]S[1]...S[N-1] consisting
of N characters. There are M queries, which are given in non-empty arrays P and
Q, each consisting of M integers. The K-th query (0 â‰¤ K < M) requires you to
find the minimal impact factor of nucleotides contained in the DNA sequence
between positions P[K] and Q[K] (inclusive).
