#Method 1
Find middle point of array.      
                                              
Find sum of lower part of array and sum of higher part of array.
               
Conditions:                                                                    
    if sum to left < sum to right, then new midpoint is current midpoint       
    +(array.length - 1 )  / 2                                                  
    if sum to left > sum to right, then new midpoint is current midpoint / 2   
    else point is equilibrium

#Method 2
Find sum of the full array

If first element is equal to total sum, then it is equilibrium point

Else, add current element to next element and do same test.
