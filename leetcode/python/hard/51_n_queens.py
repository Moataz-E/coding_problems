"""
The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an nÃ—n chessboard such
that no two queens attack each other.

Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens'
placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space
respectively.
